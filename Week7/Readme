Object-Oriented Programming with Python

This repository contains Python programs that follow the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach. 
The programs are designed to demonstrate the use of Classes, Objects, Constructors, Methods, and the math module.

Contents

Python programs demonstrating the use of Classes and Objects.

Implementation of Constructors to initialize object attributes.

Various Methods to perform operations on the objects.

Usage of Python's built-in math module for mathematical operations.

Approach

This week's programming exercises emphasize core Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Python. The following OOP elements are demonstrated in the code:

1. Classes and Objects:

Classes are used to define custom data types.

Objects are instances of these classes, and they interact with methods and attributes defined within the class.

2. Constructors:

Constructors (__init__) are used to initialize objects with specific attributes when they are created.

Example: When an object of a class is instantiated, the constructor ensures that the object starts with the correct values for its attributes.

3. Methods:

Methods are functions defined inside the class that allow objects to perform actions.

These methods can interact with the object's attributes or even call other methods within the class.

4. Math Module:

The math module is used in some programs to perform mathematical operations such as calculations, square roots, trigonometric functions, etc.

This module allows us to easily access a wide range of mathematical functions for more complex operations.

Example Structure of Programs

The programs in this repository typically have the following structure:

Class Definition:

A class is created with attributes and methods that define the object's behavior.

Constructor:

The constructor (__init__) is used to set initial values for the object when it is created.

Methods:

Several methods within the class perform specific tasks using the object's attributes and the math module.

Using the math module:

Importing the math module (import math) to handle advanced mathematical functions like math.sqrt(), math.sin(), math.factorial(), etc.

The code includes comments that explain key sections, helping you understand the implementation of OOP concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, and methods. 
The math module is also explained within the code for performing various mathematical operations.
