# Python Functions Exercises

This folder contains a series of Python exercises focused on building and using "functions" effectively. These exercises are designed to reinforce fundamental programming concepts such as:

- Creating and calling functions
- Using loops
- Working with data structures like **tuples**, **lists**, and **dictionaries**

# Highlights

# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
One of the key projects in this collection is a **Tic-Tac-Toe** game, which showcases:
- How to break down a larger problem into smaller, reusable functions
- The use of functions to handle different actions (e.g. displaying the board and checking for a win, taking user input)
- Modular coding practices

# Code Comments

Each Python file is thoroughly commented to help you understand:
- What each function does
- Why certain logic or loops are used
- How different data structures are integrated into function-based programming
